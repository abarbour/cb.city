Description: cpt-city hosts a wide range of color palettes made by Cynthia Brewer et al., and this
   offers the tools to download and import them into R.  The number of palettes available on cpt-city
   if far greater than the number in RColorBrewer, the difference being this does not keep copies
   of the palettes locally -- they must be downloaded.
